This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(fit.models)
library('reshape2')
library(robust)
library("MASS")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#Exercice 1 Summary statistics
set.seed(123)
datas <- rt(15, 1)
mean(datas) #23.03012
#The mean is not a good summary because it should be near to 0. 
#It is due to outliers points and in particular a 315

summary(datas)
df = data.frame(datas)
ggplot(df, aes(x=datas)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, colour="black", fill="white")

#We can propose the median which is less influenced to outliers
median(datas)
#The trimmed mean
mean(datas, trim = 0.2)
#Or the standart Deviation
sd(datas)
```

# Exercice3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

#Briefly describe the dataset.p

#The dataset contains datas about 87 characters of Star Wars.
#It is physical datas like name, height or skin color 
#but we have the list of movies were they appear, their vehicls and starships too 

dfStarWars <- dplyr::starwars

#Consider the variables height and mass, plot univariate charts to study the range and other summary statistics

summary(dfStarWars['height'])
summary(dfStarWars['mass'])

ggplot(dfStarWars, aes(x = height)) + geom_density() + ggtitle("Height density")
ggplot(dfStarWars, aes(x = mass)) + geom_density() + ggtitle("Mass density") + scale_x_log10()

#Plot mass vs height and describe it
ggplot(dfStarWars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Height vs Mass")

#The mass of a character seems connected to its height. For characters between 150 and 250 cm we could do 
#a linear regression because it seems to be a straight.
#We have an extreme outlier (1000kg and 175cm) which correspond to Jabba

#Fit two different regression models. Plot and discuss the results. Useful: lmrob or MASS::rlm
sub <- subset(dfStarWars, select=c(mass,height))
lmRegression <- lm(sub)
#rlmRegression <- rlm(sub)
lmRobRegression <- lmRob(data = sub)
print(lmRegression)
#print(rlmRegression)
print(lmRobRegression)
prediction <- predict(lmRegression, sub['height'])
Robustprediction <- predict(lmRobRegression, sub['height'])
heightAndMassGraph <- ggplot(dfStarWars, aes(x = height, y = mass))
heightAndMassGraph <- heightAndMassGraph + geom_point(, position = "jitter") 
heightAndMassGraph <- heightAndMassGraph + ggtitle("Height vs Mass")+geom_smooth(method = rlm, color = 'blue')
heightAndMassGraph + geom_smooth(method = lm, color = 'red', fill = 'green')
